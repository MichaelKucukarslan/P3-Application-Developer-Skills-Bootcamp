This doc is to help show the MVC pattern. 

In this project the MVC pattern will be implemented by having
the model <type>.py, the view <type>_view.py, and the controller
<type>_controller.py

The controller will start first and have the model and the view in 
memory. 

The controller will call needed functions to get the user where 
the user wants to be. 

controller: <type>_controller.py
model: <type>.py
view: <type>_view.py
